Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. AI includes fields like machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision.

Types of AI:
1. Narrow AI: Task-specific (e.g., Siri)
2. General AI: Human-level reasoning
3. Super AI: Beyond human intelligence (theoretical)

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where systems learn from data.
